    [DONE] this could be for star/ review as well. counter increment = rating / 2 -1.5

    if starred on an anime, update anime rating field avg value of all ratings OF THAT ANIME.. star/5.. 
    avg doesnt count null values in oracle avg(com_pct) = sum/count(com_pct)..
    so we can fetch the rating of the episodes as well.
